## Hurdles: reproducible research is hard

From the definition above, reproducible research sounds really easy. It is a minimum standard. But still it is hard!

Common hurdles that researchers face are:

- Missing knowledge (What am I allowed to do? How to do it?)
- Shame and fear
- Time pressure
- Data/code that cannot be shared openly

What are your personal hurdles? What can you do to address them?
