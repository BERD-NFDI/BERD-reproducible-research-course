    "text": "Overview\nThis booklet helps you implement impactful steps in making your research reproducible (and open).\nMaking your work reproducible may seem daunting right now, but we’ll take it step by step and you can choose what you want to implement now and what you want to keep for later. This is a process and there is no need to take all the steps at once. Let’s just try to move towards reproducible on the reproducibility scale.\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility scale"

Reproducible is distinct from replicable, robust and generalisable as described in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix defining reproducible research (from The Turing Way)"
