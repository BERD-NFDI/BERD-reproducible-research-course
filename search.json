    "section": "",
    "text": "FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Implementing the FAIR principles for data can be a challenge though. Let’s talk about how to do it in practice.\nThe FAIR principles are at the core of many current initiatives in research and beyond. For example the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) consortia are working on making research data (and sometimes software) FAIR. There is even a special FAIR Data Spaces project. But what does FAIR mean for you?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR prinicples\n\n\n\nThis chapter is based on ressources from the University of Mannheim, that I recommend to check out: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/FAIR-Data-Week. In the following I will use these and my own experience to give you a bit of a guidance on how to get started.\n\nGenerally for all FAIR principles\nThe FAIR principles try to help you answer the most common questions people have about data.\n\n\n\n\nFAIR questions\n\n\n\nBy the way, “data” in this context can mean many different things. Of course things like regular tabular data sets, but also images and other research materials.\n\nHow to get started\nStore your data somewhere that makes sense. If you can make your data openly available regular data platforms such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework (OSF) will do. Of course also field specific or institutional platforms/repositories are good options.\n\n\n\nView the images of this chapter on Zenodo\n\n\nIf you cannot make them openly available, you can usually still make the metadata available. Metadata is information about your data such as the author(s), how to cite it, what the data set contains, and so on.\nMaking your data known in the community increases not only your chance of creating an impact with your work but also your work’s FAIRness. You can do so by publishing a data paper or otherwise sharing more info with the community (social media, podcasts, conferences, …).\nAnd then additionally…\n\n\nF for Findable\n(Three ingredients: data, metadata and infrastructure)\n\nAttach a DOI to your data. Many data platforms (e.g. Zenodo) make that really easy for you.\nProvide rich machine-readable metadata. If you upload your data to a good data platform, the most relevant metadata will be asked from you anyhow. So it’s easy to do things right.\n\n\n\nA for Accessible\n(FAIR is not the same as Open 👉 the point is to provide the exact conditions of accessibility)\n\nExplain how someone can access your data. May that be via accessing it through a data platform or through an application that is evaluated by a data-use-and-access committee.\n\n\n\nI for Interoperable\n\nUse common data formats. For tabular data that could for example be csv, for images jpeg. What’s best in your community might be decided through a community standard.\nUse words that others will understand or define them. For example if the column names in your table are not self explanatory, explain them.\nProvide context for your data. Is it connected with other data or papers? You can also add your metadata to public knowledge graphs, e.g. Wikidata.\n\n\n\nR for Reusable\n\nInclude rich machine-readable metadata according to the community standards.\nAttach a license to your data (license is part of the metadata) that makes it clear, what others can do with your data. You can for example use the Creative Commons license CC-BY (more on how to choose a license)."

If the whole team works together, their diverse skills will help in creating a thriving and reproducible research project.\nIn The Turing Way’s Guide to Planning a Community they discuss 8 steps, that work well for a broad range of research teams:\n\nChoose a Communication Platform (e.g. GitHub + Chat + Website)\nProvide a Project Summary File (e.g. README.md)\nSelect a Code of Conduct\nProvide Contribution Guidelines and Interaction Pathways\nCreate a Basic Management/Leadership Structure (roles)\nProvide Contact Details Wherever Useful (email address to role)\nIdentify Failed Approaches, and Stop Them\nHave Documentation (e.g. a wiki) and Dissemination Plans for Your Project (e.g. publication on Zenodo)\n\nNote that there are two important parts fo thriving teams:\n\nDocuments (wiki, checklist, …)\nRoles of people (research software engineer, welcome team, …)\n\nHow is your team set up?

I had hundreds of files with dubious file names and sometimes several files with similar code written for computing on different infrastructures (my computer, the institute server, the cluster of the computing facility).\nI felt like the worst researcher of all times. But I wasn’t. Many struggle with organizing their files and folders in increasingly complex research projects.\n\nHow to organize files and folders well?\nIt basically comes down to structuring folders and files systematically from the beginning.\nThink about what a good folder structure could be for your research project. A standard project of mine looks something like this:\n.\n├── analysis            &lt;- all things data analysis\n│   └── src             &lt;- functions and other source files\n├── comm\n│   ├── internal_comm   &lt;- internal communication such as meeting notes\n│   └── journal_comm    &lt;- communication with the journal, e.g. peer review\n├── data\n│   ├── data_clean      &lt;- clean version of the data\n│   └── data_raw        &lt;- raw data (don't touch)\n├── dissemination\n│   ├── manuscripts\n│   ├── posters\n│   └── presentations\n├── documentation       &lt;- documentation, e.g. data management plan\n└── misc                &lt;- miscellaneous files that don't fit elsewhere\nYou can download this folder structure as a template from https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/research-project-template.\nNot every project is the same and likely your project will be more complex than this. But if you think about good organization from the beginning, it will be easier in the long run.\nWhat do you think about file or folder organization?

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this chapter we discuss research documentation for reproducible research.\nHow can I document my research outputs?\nThere is actually no super-clear catch all answer to this question. It really depends on your needs, on your audience as well as on the types of research outputs you generate. In the following you find a few ideas to start from.\n\nDocumenting research projects\nOne thing that I always do is to add a README-Text-File to each project. In the README I write the most important info about the project: What is it about? Who is involved? Where to find files? How to cite it? Where to find the paper? …\nAs an example, check out my project on personalised medicine.\nFor more complex research projects, you can create a whole wiki or similar to describe the project. For most projects a README will be just fine.\n\n\nDocumenting data\nMetadata is central to documentation of data. Metadata is information about your data. It’s information on the license of the data, who owns it, what information the data contain, … so essential data documentation.\nMany research fields have standards for metadata. If you can’t find one for your field you can use a common standard (e.g. Dublin Core) or just ask a data manager or librarian at your institution. You can write metadata similar to a README (see e.g. this guide from Cornell University). If you upload your data to a data platform (e.g. Dryad) you won’t have to think about it as the platform usually takes care of that (Dryad uses Dublin Core).\n\n\nDocumenting code\nTo make my code as understandable as possible for others, I use literate programming (mixing text and code to make it easier to read, e.g. Quarto) or add clear code comments. When writing functions in R I additionally use the standardized way to document R functions (via Roxygen2).\nAn example of code comments in R (##):\n\n## Load package + data\nlibrary(\"model4you\")\ndata(\"MathExam14W\", package = \"psychotools\")\n\n## scale points achieved to [0, 100] percent\nMathExam14W$tests &lt;- 100 * MathExam14W$tests/26\nMathExam14W$pcorrect &lt;- 100 * MathExam14W$nsolved/13\n\n## select variables to be used\nMathExam &lt;- MathExam14W[ , c(\"pcorrect\", \"group\", \"tests\", \"study\",\n                             \"attempt\", \"semester\", \"gender\")]\n\n\n\nDocumenting other things\nWhatever you work on, there might be parts of your research project that are difficult to understand. Say you work in a lab, then your documentation is a lab notebook. Or you do interviews, then your documentation may be your interview strategy. Anything that might be useful for others is worth keeping and worth sharing. After all, we all want to build on the work of others in order to make the world a little better.\n\n\nFurther reading\nWant to learn more?

    "text": "This topic may sound technical and boring at first, but please bare with me 🙏. It will be useful!\nHave you ever had the problem that you ran an old code and it just did not work anymore? After hours of digging into the issue you find that it’s because the software package you use has changed in the meantime 🧐\nOr have you tried to reproduce someone else’s code, which seems to run on their machine but not on yours and you just don’t know why.\nThis chapter is all about avoiding such problems in the future by stabilizing your computing environment and software. ✅\n\nWhat is a computing environment?\nYour computing environment is defined by your computer, the operating system and the software installed. If you update your operating system or your software, your computing environment changes. In R, for example, you can learn a lot about your computing environment by typing sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\nRunning under: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3\nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C           LC_TIME=C.UTF-8       \n [4] LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=C.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=C.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=C.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C              LC_ADDRESS=C          \n[10] LC_TELEPHONE=C         LC_MEASUREMENT=C.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C   \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] compiler_4.2.0  fastmap_1.1.1   cli_3.6.1       htmltools_0.5.5\n [5] tools_4.2.0     yaml_2.3.7      rmarkdown_2.21  knitr_1.42     \n [9] jsonlite_1.8.4  xfun_0.39       digest_0.6.31   rlang_1.1.1    \n[13] renv_1.0.0      evaluate_0.20  \n\n\nIt tells the R version, operating system, loaded R packages as well as their versions.\n\n\nOptions for stabilizing your computing environment\n\n1) Record your computing environment\nDocument the software versions you used. For example if you use R, you could copy the output of sessionInfo() into your README or somewhere else where future you (and others) can find this information. This is not exactly “stabilizing” but it gives the possibility to install the same software versions again.\n\n\n2) Use one virtual machine per research project\nYou don’t need to know what a virtual machine is or how to set it up to be able to do this. I used to ask the wonderful IT person at my institute to set up a virtual machine for me and if your IT supporters know their job, they’ll be able to help you here.\nA virtual machine is essentially a virtual computer on another computer or server (To those nerds out there, I know I am probably explaining it incorrectly but for the purpose of what we want to achieve here, it’s good enough). If you have one virtual machine for each project, you can keep the computing environment stable by not installing or updating software after you’ve finished the research project.\nThe downside of this strategy is that this is only for future you and your collaborators, but not for other researchers who want to work with the same computing environment.\n\n\n3) Use one container per research project\nContainers are similar to virtual machines (think little computer inside your computer). The big difference is that you can make them available for others. So you can send your container image (or the file describing it) to others.\n\n\n\nPopular container tools are Docker and Apptainer (formerly Singularity). Learning to work with containers is not super easy, but it is worth the time and actually can be applied in so many other situations. So, a great skill to have even if you decide to quit research.\n\n\n4) Other\nThere are many other options out there. I wrote down the three that are least dependent on the actual software you use. For R users, check out packages logrx, rang, packrat, versions, and renv.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nReproducible Environments, The Turing Way\nVideo: How can software containers help your research?, Paula Andrea Martinez + Australian Research Data Commons\nR Docker tutorial, maintained by Jemma Stachelek\n\nThat’s all for this chapter. I hope it was helpful and not too technical. Happy researching! 🙌"
