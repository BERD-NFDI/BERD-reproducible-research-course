    "text": "FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Implementing the FAIR principles for data can be a challenge though. Let‚Äôs talk about how to do it in practice.\nThe FAIR principles are at the core of many current initiatives in research and beyond. For example the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) consortia are working on making research data (and sometimes software) FAIR. There is even a special FAIR Data Spaces project. But what does FAIR mean for you?\n\n\n\n\nFAIR prinicples\n\n\n\nThis chapter is based on ressources from the University of Mannheim, that I recommend to check out: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/FAIR-Data-Week. In the following I will use these and my own experience to give you a bit of a guidance on how to get started.\n\nWhat are the FAIR principles for?\nThe FAIR principles try to help you answer the most common questions people have about data.\n\n\n\n\nFAIR questions\n\n\n\nBy the way, ‚Äúdata‚Äù in this context can mean many different things. Of course things like regular tabular data sets, but also images and other research materials.\n\n\nHow to get started\nStore your data somewhere that makes sense. If you can make your data openly available regular data platforms such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework (OSF) will do. Of course also field specific or institutional platforms/repositories are good options.\n\n\n\nView the images of this chapter on Zenodo\n\n\nIf you cannot make them openly available, you can usually still make the metadata available. Metadata is information about your data such as the author(s), how to cite it, what the data set contains, and so on.\nMaking your data known in the community increases not only your chance of creating an impact with your work but also your work‚Äôs FAIRness. You can do so by publishing a data paper or otherwise sharing more info with the community (social media, podcasts, conferences, ‚Ä¶).\nAnd then additionally‚Ä¶\n\n\nF for Findable\n(Three ingredients: data, metadata and infrastructure)\n\nAttach a DOI to your data. Many data platforms (e.g.¬†Zenodo) make that really easy for you.\nProvide rich machine-readable metadata. If you upload your data to a good data platform, the most relevant metadata will be asked from you anyhow. So it‚Äôs easy to do things right.\n\n\n\nA for Accessible\n(FAIR is not the same as Open üëâ the point is to provide the exact conditions of accessibility)\n\nExplain how someone can access your data. May that be via accessing it through a data platform or through an application that is evaluated by a data-use-and-access committee.\n\n\n\nI for Interoperable\n\nUse common data formats. For tabular data that could for example be csv, for images jpeg. What‚Äôs best in your community might be decided through a community standard.\nUse words that others will understand or define them. For example if the column names in your table are not self explanatory, explain them.\nProvide context for your data. Is it connected with other data or papers? You can also add your metadata to public knowledge graphs, e.g.¬†Wikidata.\n\n\n\nR for Reusable\n\nInclude rich machine-readable metadata according to the community standards.\nAttach a license to your data (license is part of the metadata) that makes it clear, what others can do with your data. You can for example use the Creative Commons license CC-BY (more on how to choose a license)."

But I wasn‚Äôt. Many struggle with organizing their files and folders in increasingly complex research projects.\n\nHow to organize files and folders well?\nIt basically comes down to structuring folders and files systematically from the beginning.\nThink about what a good folder structure could be for your research project. A standard project of mine looks something like this:\n.\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis            &lt;- all things data analysis\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src             &lt;- functions and other source files\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ comm\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal_comm   &lt;- internal communication such as meeting notes\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ journal_comm    &lt;- communication with the journal, e.g. peer review\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_clean      &lt;- clean version of the data\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data_raw        &lt;- raw data (don't touch)\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dissemination\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manuscripts\n‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posters\n‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentations\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation       &lt;- documentation, e.g. data management plan\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ misc                &lt;- miscellaneous files that don't fit elsewhere\nYou can download this folder structure as a template from https://github.com/HeidiSeibold/research-project-template.\nNot every project is the same and likely your project will be more complex than this.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this chapter we discuss research documentation for reproducible research.\nHow can I document my research outputs?\nThere is actually no super-clear catch all answer to this question. It really depends on your needs, on your audience as well as on the types of research outputs you generate. In the following you find a few ideas to start from.\n\nDocumenting research projects\nOne thing that I always do is to add a README-Text-File to each project. In the README I write the most important info about the project: What is it about? Who is involved? Where to find files? How to cite it? Where to find the paper? ‚Ä¶\nAs an example, check out my project on personalised medicine.\nFor more complex research projects, you can create a whole wiki or similar to describe the project. For most projects a README will be just fine.\n\n\nDocumenting data\nMetadata is central to documentation of data. Metadata is information about your data. It‚Äôs information on the license of the data, who owns it, what information the data contain, ‚Ä¶ so essential data documentation.\nMany research fields have standards for metadata. If you can‚Äôt find one for your field you can use a common standard (e.g.¬†Dublin Core) or just ask a data manager or librarian at your institution. You can write metadata similar to a README (see e.g.¬†this guide from Cornell University). If you upload your data to a data platform (e.g.¬†Dryad) you won‚Äôt have to think about it as the platform usually takes care of that (Dryad uses Dublin Core).\n\n\nDocumenting code\nTo make my code as understandable as possible for others, I use literate programming (mixing text and code to make it easier to read, e.g.¬†Quarto) or add clear code comments. When writing functions in R I additionally use the standardized way to document R functions (via Roxygen2).\nAn example of code comments in R (##):\n\n## Load package + data\nlibrary(\"model4you\")\ndata(\"MathExam14W\", package = \"psychotools\")\n\n## scale points achieved to [0, 100] percent\nMathExam14W$tests &lt;- 100 * MathExam14W$tests/26\nMathExam14W$pcorrect &lt;- 100 * MathExam14W$nsolved/13\n\n## select variables to be used\nMathExam &lt;- MathExam14W[ , c(\"pcorrect\", \"group\", \"tests\", \"study\",\n                             \"attempt\", \"semester\", \"gender\")]\n\n\n\nDocumenting other things\nWhatever you work on, there might be parts of your research project that are difficult to understand. Say you work in a lab, then your documentation is a lab notebook. Or you do interviews, then your documentation may be your interview strategy. Anything that might be useful for others is worth keeping and worth sharing. After all, we all want to build on the work of others in order to make the world a little better.\n\n\nFurther reading\nWant to learn more?

    "text": "This topic may sound technical and boring at first, but please bare with me üôè. It will be useful!\nHave you ever had the problem that you ran an old code and it just did not work anymore? After hours of digging into the issue you find that it‚Äôs because the software package you use has changed in the meantime üßê\nOr have you tried to reproduce someone else‚Äôs code, which seems to run on their machine but not on yours and you just don‚Äôt know why.\nThis chapter is all about avoiding such problems in the future by stabilizing your computing environment and software. ‚úÖ\n\nWhat is a computing environment?\nYour computing environment is defined by your computer, the operating system and the software installed. If you update your operating system or your software, your computing environment changes. In R, for example, you can learn a lot about your computing environment by typing sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\nRunning under: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libblas.so.3\nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.20.so\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C           LC_TIME=C.UTF-8       \n [4] LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=C.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=C.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=C.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C              LC_ADDRESS=C          \n[10] LC_TELEPHONE=C         LC_MEASUREMENT=C.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C   \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] compiler_4.2.0  fastmap_1.1.1   cli_3.6.1       htmltools_0.5.5\n [5] tools_4.2.0     yaml_2.3.7      rmarkdown_2.21  knitr_1.42     \n [9] jsonlite_1.8.4  xfun_0.39       digest_0.6.31   rlang_1.1.1    \n[13] renv_1.0.0      evaluate_0.20  \n\n\nIt tells the R version, operating system, loaded R packages as well as their versions.\n\n\nOptions for stabilizing your computing environment\n\n1) Record your computing environment\nDocument the software versions you used. For example if you use R, you could copy the output of sessionInfo() into your README or somewhere else where future you (and others) can find this information. This is not exactly ‚Äústabilizing‚Äù but it gives the possibility to install the same software versions again.\n\n\n2) Use one virtual machine per research project\nYou don‚Äôt need to know what a virtual machine is or how to set it up to be able to do this. I used to ask the wonderful IT person at my institute to set up a virtual machine for me and if your IT supporters know their job, they‚Äôll be able to help you here.\nA virtual machine is essentially a virtual computer on another computer or server (To those nerds out there, I know I am probably explaining it incorrectly but for the purpose of what we want to achieve here, it‚Äôs good enough). If you have one virtual machine for each project, you can keep the computing environment stable by not installing or updating software after you‚Äôve finished the research project.\nThe downside of this strategy is that this is only for future you and your collaborators, but not for other researchers who want to work with the same computing environment.\n\n\n3) Use one container per research project\nContainers are similar to virtual machines (think little computer inside your computer). The big difference is that you can make them available for others. So you can send your container image (or the file describing it) to others.\n\n\n\nPopular container tools are Docker and Apptainer (formerly Singularity). Learning to work with containers is not super easy, but it is worth the time and actually can be applied in so many other situations. So, a great skill to have even if you decide to quit research.\n\n\n4) Other\nThere are many other options out there. I wrote down the three that are least dependent on the actual software you use. For R users, check out packages logrx, rang, packrat, versions, and renv.\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nReproducible Environments, The Turing Way\nVideo: How can software containers help your research?, Paula Andrea Martinez + Australian Research Data Commons\nR Docker tutorial, maintained by Jemma Stachelek\n\nThat‚Äôs all for this chapter. I hope it was helpful and not too technical. Happy researching! üôå"

This is the license I use 90% of the time.\n\n\nWhy not non-commercial?\nCC-BY-NC is another license I often see used, but I do not like it in the context of research. Why? The ‚ÄúNC‚Äù for non-commerical prohibits commercial use for anyone but the owner. That means, for example, that educators (like me) cannot use it, if there are fees or commercial learning platforms involved. Even blogs and Wikipedia struggle with NC if there are commercial derivatives or components. Read more here.\n\n\n\nChoosing a license for software\nSoftware needs specific licenses. So for software there is another website you can use for choosing a license.\nhttps://choosealicense.com\nAgain there is a license that works for most open projects: the MIT license.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://choosealicense.com\n\n\n\nThat seems pretty simple, right? For more complex situations and when you have to worry about license compatibility of your code with software components that you use, please check out:\n\nThe Turing Way chapter on License Compatibility\nTalk ‚ÄúAll you need to know about Software Licenses‚Äù by Tobias Schlauch\n\n\n\nOther\nFor other licenses, such as for hardware, choosealicense.com also has help for you: choosealicense.com/non-software\nI hope this short intro to licensing was helpful to you! Please note that I am not a legal expert but a self taught open science enthusiast."

But how can you do better? How can you make your research outputs available?\n\nPublish in a repository\nPublish your research outputs in a repository. You basically have three options here:\n\nA general purpose service (e.g.¬†Zenodo or Open Science Framework),\nThe service of your institution (e.g.¬†Open Data LMU or ETH Zurich‚Äôs Research Collection),\nA field or project specific service (e.g.¬†a specific repository for high throughput sequencing data or CRAN for R-Packages)\n\nPlease make sure to use a trustworthy service. How to check if a service is trustworthy? My rule of thumb is that services that have investor backing (e.g.¬†Figshare) are less trustworthy than services backed by the research community (e.g.¬†Zenodo, which is developed by OpenAIRE and CERN). Why? Well, I think an Open Science service should not be driven primarily by commercial goals. At some point commercial services will take money from you, if that may be by selling your data, by locking your uploaded material behind a pay wall, or in another way.\n\n\nPublish with the paper\nSome journals offer to publish your research outputs with your paper. I will be honest, I have mixed feelings about this. Not all journals which offer this, really have the expertise to do so and they don‚Äôt necessarily have the possibility to store data long term. For one of my papers we uploaded the material with the journal, but the link to the material keeps vanishing and I keep getting the confused emails of interested readers. So, make sure the journal you upload your material to, ensures long term storage and availability üßê.\n\n\nIf your research outputs cannot be shared openly\nWhat should you do if you cannot publish your research outputs openly?\nIf you have sensitive data (e.g.¬†patient data) and no consent, do not publish the data! There are other options for you.\nIf for any reason you cannot share your research outputs, think of options how you can still ensure that others can trust in the reproducibility of your research.\n\nCan you maybe publish the metadata and the code?\nCan you publish a synthetic version of your data?\nCan you share the data with specific people (e.g.¬†researchers in the same field)?\n\nBrainstorm with your peers, librarians, or IT support. There are always solutions that are better than publishing nothing.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nZenodo Guide\nHow create an OSF project"
