# Overview {.unnumbered}

This booklet helps you implement impactful steps in **making your research reproducible** (and open). 

Making your work reproducible may seem daunting right now, but we'll take it **step by step** and you can choose what you want to implement now and what you want to keep for later. This is a process and there is no need to take all the steps at once. Let's just try to move towards reproducible on the reproducibility scale.
