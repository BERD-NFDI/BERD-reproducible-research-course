that the previous. Please plan for this.

## Tasks

Read this chapter and watch this week's videos. 
Afterwards go through the following assignments:

- Install git (see Booklet)
- Create a Github account (if you donâ€™t yet have any)

Practical Task 1: Work on your own Github repository

- Create a Git repository on GitHub or GitLab (you can call it e.g. "sandbox" or "just-trying-Git" ðŸ˜‰). Then `clone` it, edit a file, `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes back to Github.  

Practical task 2: Contribute to someone elseâ€™s repository  

- Fork the following repository (it contains the file structure you should be already familiar with) : https://github.com/likeajumprope/BERD_course
- Make a change to some of the files. For example, you can add a code comment (a command that is not executed) using the # symbol
- Commit your changes.
- Make a pull request to the original (my) repository. Make sure to summarize your changes and write a nice commit message.

Optional Tasks:

- Create a Git repository for your current research project.
- Think of things you would like to see improved in our course booklet (Alternatively: view the [open issues](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/issues)) and choose one thing where you can make a contribution. Create a [fork](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/fork) of the [booklet project](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course) and then a [pull request](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/pulls) with your contribution and mark it in the respective issue.

Discuss your progress and potential issues with your accountability buddy.
