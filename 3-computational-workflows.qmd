- You will have the version control system git installed on your computer and be able to run the important commands.

- You will be able to keep your computing environment stable.

- You will have a roadmap on how to automate your code.

This week's assignments are a bit more difficult and will take longer to implement
that the previous. Please plan for this.

## Tasks

Read this chapter and watch this week's videos. 
Afterwards go through the following assignments:

- Install git: For R users, I recommend following [these](https://gitlab.com/HeidiSeibold/setup-git-rstudio-gitlab) instructions. Otherwise the Carpentries have good [instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html) for all systems (follow along until end of `2. Setting up Git`)
- Create a project on GitLab (or GitHub). Then `clone` it, edit a file, `add`, 
`commit`, and `push` your changes.
- Optional: Think of things you would like to see improved in our course booklet (Alternatively: view the [open issues](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/issues)) and choose one thing where you can make a contribution. Create a [fork](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/fork) of the [booklet project](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course) and then a [pull request](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/pulls) with your contribution and mark it in the respective issue.
- Optional: try using Make to automate something in your current research project.

Discuss your progress with your accountability buddy.
