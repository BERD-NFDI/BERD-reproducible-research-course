This week's assignments are a bit more difficult and will take longer to implement
that the previous. Please plan for this.

## Tasks

Read this chapter and watch this week's videos. 
Afterwards go through the following assignments:

- Install git: For R users, I recommend following [these](https://gitlab.com/HeidiSeibold/setup-git-rstudio-gitlab) instructions. Otherwise the Carpentries have good [instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html) for all systems (follow along until end of `2. Setting up Git`)
- Create a project on GitLab (or GitHub). Then `clone` it, edit a file, `add`, 
`commit`, and `push` your changes.
- View the open issues for our course booklet and choose one where you can make a contribution. Create a [fork](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/fork) of the [booklet project](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course) and then a [pull request](https://github.com/BERD-NFDI/BERD-reproducible-research-course/pulls) with your contribution and mark it in the respective issue.
- Optional: try using Make to automate something in your current research project.

Discuss your progress with your accountability buddy. Bring any questions and
problems that you cannot solve with your buddy to the weekly meeting.
